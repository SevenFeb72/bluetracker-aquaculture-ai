## 2. üîç Problem Statement

Aquaculture farms in Australia face serious sustainability challenges due to nutrient discharge, outdated manual data systems, and delayed response to water-quality changes. Events like mass fish deaths in Menindee and rising nitrogen levels in the Great Barrier Reef show the urgent need for smarter monitoring. Manual spreadsheets slow down detection and action, while lack of transparency erodes public trust. A digital solution is needed to help farmers respond faster, reduce waste, and protect marine ecosystems.

## 3. üå± Solution & SDG Alignment

BlueTracker is a smart aquaculture monitoring platform that replaces manual spreadsheets with real-time data collection and AI-powered insights. Farmers can input or automatically collect water-quality data (oxygen, pH, temperature, ammonia), and the system analyzes trends to predict risks. For example, if oxygen is likely to drop overnight, BlueTracker sends an alert to start aeration early. If ammonia toxicity risk rises, it suggests adjusting feed or water exchange.

The platform supports:
- **SDG 14.1** ‚Äì Reduce nutrient pollution  
- **SDG 14.2** ‚Äì Protect marine ecosystems  
- **SDG 12** ‚Äì Promote responsible production and transparent supply chains

It also provides a tamper-proof audit trail for regulators and buyers, improving trust in Australian seafood.

## 4. ü§ñ AI Tools & Usage

Due to time constraints, our current prototype focuses on frontend functionality and data visualization. However, we have designed the system to integrate AI tools in future development. These include:

- **Time-series forecasting models** (e.g. Prophet) to predict oxygen and ammonia fluctuations  
- **Anomaly detection algorithms** to flag sudden drops or spikes  
- **Python + Pandas** for data processing and model integration  
- **Copilot AI assistant** to debug frontend logic and streamline UX

These tools will allow BlueTracker to convert raw sensor data into actionable insights, helping farmers prevent fish kills and optimize operations.

## 5. üß∞ Tech Stack Overview

Our current prototype uses:
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Design:** Figma  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

Planned backend integration includes:
- **Backend:** Python Flask or Node.js  
- **AI Models:** Scikit-learn, Prophet  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Deployment:** Docker, GitHub Actions

This stack was chosen for scalability, ease of integration with IoT sensors, and compatibility with aquaculture data formats.

## 6. üß™ Demo Description

The prototype includes a dashboard where farmers can view water-quality trends and receive alerts. Users can upload CSV data and visualize oxygen, pH, and ammonia levels. While backend and AI models are not yet implemented, we have a clear roadmap for expansion.

Future development will include:
- Python Flask backend to receive real-time sensor data  
- AI models for predictive alerts  
- PostgreSQL database for secure logging  
- Docker deployment for scalability

These additions will allow BlueTracker to become a fully integrated aquaculture monitoring platform, supporting both environmental and operational goals.
